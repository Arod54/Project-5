       And yes I am currently working on HTML and CSS so bare with me; sit back and enjoy the show while I try to create my future in this feild (also feel free to laugh all you want or even cry
       with me). As of right now this is what I have begun with, on this page you will find about me, my update on how it's going while being a student at correlation-one and what I am learning,
       you will also see my projects or what I am currrently working on. If you have any questions or want to recieve updates on how it's going, please feel free to write your information

    <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p> 
        I am 23 years old born and raised in Las, Vegas Nevada and enrolled in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.correlation-one.com/">Correlation one</a> to get experience in software devlopment, is it hard?
        Heck yeah, but nothing isn't fun without a struggle and a sacrifice. But hopefully after completing this program (because I will pass this program in honors)
        I want to eventually transition into a full stack devloper career; even if that means that I have to enroll into another course to learn more languages. 
        If you would like to learn more about me I created this on my first page while barely learning html!

    <h2>Blog:</h2>
      <p> 
        As someone that is starting to get into learning HTML and CSS <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">w3schools</a> has been such
        a huge help. And if I can't find it there, then there are so many smart people on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">
        Youtube</a>. Plus I know my journey just started and I may be pulling my hair every now and then but I feel like there are so many resources out there that can 
        answer any question you're stuck on. Like even the other day I was on another social media platform and a content creator popped up and started giving out advice on 
        a question that someone asked in the comment section! Just from what I have seen and what I have experienced with my classmates, I feel like this field has a lot of helping 
        hands. But again, I just started so I will update you in a couple of months/years. But anyways coding is for sure something I want to keep getting better at.

    <h2>Projects:</h2>
      <p> 
        As of right now I only have one project (which is my about me) that I have finished but eventually I would like to end up creating something that I can use on a daily bases and <u>eventually</u>
        share with others; still haven't really decided what it could be but through time I will figure it out. Thankfully, thanks to the course I am currently enrolled in, I have
        been able to mess with HTML and CSS in class by the assignments that we work on while we're in class. And hopefully soon I can start a project with my team and hopefully maybe
        even connect with some of them and who knows; maybe a project for all of us can be brain-stormed and created by all of us.
